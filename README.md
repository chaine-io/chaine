### Process Flow Diagram
Below is a high level process flow diagram to depict how we envision our "Global (Parent) Chain" and the "National (Child) Chains". We've also tried to show how we plan to interact with some of the other existing projects in this domain, particularly the ones that are part of the [SDG Insights Challenge](https://sdginsights.uniteideas.spigit.com/Page/ViewIdeas).
